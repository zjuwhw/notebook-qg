# Changes of Gene Frequency

There are two sorts of process through which changes of gene frequency, and consequently of genotype frequencies, are brought about:

- systematic processes, which tend to change the gene frequency in a manner predictable both in amount and in direction
  - migration
  - mutation
  - selection
- dispersive process, which arises in small populations from the effects of sampling, and is predictable in amount but not in direction.

## Migration

A large population consists of a proportion m of new immigrants in each generation, let the frequency of a certain gene(allele) be $q_m$ ammong the immigrants and $q_0$ among the natives. The frequency of the gene in the mixed population $q_1$, will be:

$$q_1 = mq_m + (1-m)q_0 = m(q_m-q_0)+q_0$$

the change of gene frequency, $\Delta q$,

$$\Delta q = q_1 - q_0 = m(q_m - q_0)$$

It shows the rate of change of gene frequency in a population subject ot immigration depends, as much be obvious, on the immigration rate and on the difference of gene frequency between immigrants and natives.

## Mutation

### Non-recurrent mutation

### Recurrent mutation

## Selection

### Change of gene frequency under selection

### Effectiveness of selection

### Number of generations required

### Average fitness and load

## Equilibria

### Balance between mutation and selection

### Changes of equilibrium

### Selection favouring heterozygotes

## Polymorphism
