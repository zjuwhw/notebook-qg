Population: in the genetic sense, a population is not just a group of individuals, but a breeding group; and the genetics of a population is concerned not only with the genetic constitution of the individuals but also with the transmission of the genes from one generation to the next. The genetic constitution of a population, refering to the genes it carries, is described by the array of gene(alleles) frequencies; that is, by specification of the alleles present at every locus and the numbers or proportions of the different alleles at each locus. Frequencies Genes(Alleles) \\(A_1\\) p \\(A_2\\) q Genotypes \\(A_1A_1\\) P \\(A_1A_2\\) H \\(A_2A_2\\) Q p + q =1 P + H + Q = 1 \\(p = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\) and \\(q = Q+ \\frac{1}{2}H\\) 2.1.1 Mendelian variation in natural populations large effects vs small effects restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs Microsatllite (or simple sequence repeat, SSR) polymorphic loci 2.1.2 Causes of change The agencies through which the genetic properties of a population may be changed are these: Population size Differences of fertility(繁殖能力) and viability(生存能力): selection Migration and mutation Mating system random mating (or panmixia) means that any individual has an equal chance of mating with any other individual in the population. 2.2 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 2.2.1 The Hardy-Weinberg law In a large random-mating population with no selection, mutation, or migration, the gene frequencies and the genotype frequenies are constant from generation to generation; and, furthermore, there is a simple relationship between the gene frequencies and the genotype frequencies. These properties of a population are derived from a theorem, or principle, known as the Hardy-Weinberg law after Hardy and Weinberg, who independently demonstrated them in 1908. A population with constant gene and genotype frequencies is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

So the normal heterozygotes frquency is 2q(1-q). The percent of heterozygotes among normal individuals is \\[H&#39; = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{2q(1-q) + (1-q)^2} = \\frac{2q}{1+q}\\] - Test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 2.2.3 Mating frequencies and another proof of the Hardy-Weinberg law Table 1.3 Nine types of mating \\(A_1A_1\\)(P) \\(A_1A_2\\)(H) \\(A_2A_2\\)(Q) \\(A_1A_1\\)(P) \\(P^2\\) PH PQ \\(A_1A_2\\)(H) PH \\(H^2\\) HQ \\(A_2A_2\\)(Q) PQ HQ \\(Q^2\\) Table 1.4 mating type mating freuqncy frequency \\(A_1A_1\\) frequency \\(A_1A_2\\) frequency \\(A_2A_2\\) \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_1A_1\\) \\(P^2\\) \\(P^2\\) - - \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_1A_2\\) 2PH PH PH - \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_2A_2\\) 2PQ - 2PQ - \\(A_1A_2 \\times A_1A_2\\) \\(H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4}H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4}H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}H^2\\) \\(A_1A_2 \\times A_2A_2\\) 2HQ - HQ HQ \\(A_2A_2 \\times A_2A_2\\) \\(Q^2\\) - - \\(Q^2\\) Sums \\(p^2\\) 2pq \\(q^2\\) 2.2.4 Multiple alleles When there are more than 2 alleles at a locus, the genotype frequencies are determined by the gene(allele) frequencies in exactly the same way as with two alleles. 2.2.5 Sex-linked genes For homogametic sex (human females), gene and genotype frequency is the same as with the autosomal gene, but the heterogametic sex (human males) has only two genotypes and each individual carries only one gene instead of two. So 2/3 (4 out of 6) sex-linked alleles are carried by females and 1/3 by males in the population. Consider two alleles, A1 and A2, with frequencies p and q, and the genotypic frequencies as follow: Frequencies Females \\(A_1A_1\\) P \\(A_1A_2\\) H \\(A_2A_2\\) Q Males \\(A_1\\) R \\(A_2\\) S For females, the A1 frequncy \\(p_f = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\); for males, the \\(p_m = R\\), so the frequency of \\(A_1\\) in the whole population is, \\[\\bar{p} = \\frac{2}{3}p_f + \\frac{1}{3}p_m = \\frac{1}{3}(2P + H + R)\\] Males get their sex-linked genes only from their mothers, and females get their sex-linked genes equally from both parents. So \\[p_m^{&#39;} =p_f\\text{ and }p_f^{&#39;}=\\frac{1}{2}(p_m + p_f)\\] where, \\(p_m^{&#39;}\\) and \\(p_f^{&#39;}\\) are the gene frequnce in the progeny generation. The differnce between the frequencies in the two sexes is \\[p_f^{&#39;}-p_m^{&#39;} = \\frac{1}{2}(p_m + p_f) -p_f = -\\frac{1}{2}(p_f - p_m)\\] Therefore the distribution of the genes between the two sexes oscillates, but the difference is halved in successive generations and the population rapidly approaches an equilibrium in which the frequencies in the two sexs are equal. GetGeneFreq_whole = function(pf, pm){ ### We assume the number of males and females are equal in the population return(2/3*pf + 1/3*pm) } GetGeneFreq_sex_next = function(pf,pm){ pm_next = pf pf_next = 1/2*(pm+pf) return(c(pf_next, pm_next)) } data = c() pf = 1; pm = 0; gene=0 data = rbind(data, data.frame(gene=gene, female=pf, male=pm, whole=GetGeneFreq_whole(pf,pm))) for(gene in 1:10){ pfm = GetGeneFreq_sex_next(pf,pm) pf = pfm[1]; pm=pfm[2] data = rbind(data, data.frame(gene=gene, female=pf, male=pm, whole=GetGeneFreq_whole(pf,pm))) } library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) data.melt = melt(data, id.vars = &quot;gene&quot;) ggplot(data.melt, aes(x=gene, y=value,colour=variable), group = variable) + geom_line() + ggtitle(&quot;Approach to equilibrium under random mating for a sex-linked gene&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Generation&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Gene(allele) Frequency&quot;) 2.2.6 More than one locus Disequilibrium with respect to two or more loci is called gametic phase disequilibrium, or linkage disequilibrium, irrespective of whether the loci are linked or not. Disequilibrium can arise from intermixture of populations with different gene frequencies, or from chance in small populations. Disequilibrium can also be produced, and maintained, by selection favouring one combination of alleles over another.

Because 1-pchisq(0.93,1)=0.3348629, it’s also not significance, but less than 0.5. The maximum of the absolute value of D is 0.25 when \\(p_A = q_A = p_B = q_B = 0.5\\). \\(D_{max}\\) is the largest numerical value D coud be, given the observed gene fequncies. If two loci are linked on the same chromosome, the gamete type \\(A_1B_1\\) in the progeny generation can be obtainded from \\(A_1B_1/A_xB_x\\) without recombination or \\(A_1B_x/A_xB_1\\) with recombination. The frequency of the former situation is r(1-c), r being the frequency of \\(A_1B_1\\) in the parental gamets and c the recombination frequncy. The frequency of later situation is \\(p_Ap_Bc\\). therefore the frequency of \\(A_1B_1\\) in the progeny gamets is \\[r&#39; = r(1-c) + p_Ap_Bc\\] and the disequilibrium in the progeny generation is \\[D&#39; = r&#39; - p_Ap_B = D(1-c)\\] In a more general way, after any number t of generations, the disequilibrium is given by \\[D_t = D_0 (1-c)^t\\] plot(c(0,12),c(0,1),col=&quot;white&quot;,main=&quot;Approach to equilibrium under random mating of two loci, considered jointly.&quot;,xlab=&quot;Generation&quot;, ylab=&quot;D&quot;) t = 0:12;d0 = 1 lines(t,d0*(1-0.05)^t, col=1);text(10,0.7,&quot;0.05&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.1)^t, col=2);text(9,0.47,&quot;0.1&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.2)^t, col=3);text(7,0.3,&quot;0.2&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.3)^t, col=4);text(6,0.2,&quot;0.3&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.5)^t, col=5);text(4.5,0.1,&quot;0.5&quot;) 2.3 Non-random mating There are two distinct forms of non-random mating. The first is when mated individuals are related to each other by ancestral descent. This tends to increase the frequencies of homozygotes at all loci. The second is when individuals tend to mate preferentially with respect to their genotypes at any particular locus under consideration. If mated pairs are of the same phenotype more often than would occur by chance, this is called assortative mating, and if less often, it is called disassortative mating. 2.3.1 Assortative mating The effect of assortative mating on genotype frequencies among progeny is to increase the frequencies of homzygotes and reduce that of heterozygotes.

["changes-of-gene-frequency.html", "3 Changes of Gene Frequency 3.1 Migration 3.2 Mutation 3.3 Selection 3.4 Equilibria 3.5 Polymorphism", " 3 Changes of Gene Frequency There are two sorts of process through which changes of gene frequency, and consequently of genotype frequencies, are brought about: systematic processes, which tend to change the gene frequency in a manner predictable both in amount and in direction migration mutation selection dispersive process, which arises in small populations from the effects of sampling, and is predictable in amount but not in direction. 3.1 Migration A large population consists of a proportion m of new immigrants in each generation, let the frequency of a certain gene(allele) be \\(q_m\\) ammong the immigrants and \\(q_0\\) among the natives. The frequency of the gene in the mixed population \\(q_1\\), will be: \\[q_1 = mq_m + (1-m)q_0 = m(q_m-q_0)+q_0\\] the change of gene frequency, \\(\\Delta q\\), \\[\\Delta q = q_1 - q_0 = m(q_m - q_0)\\] It shows the rate of change of gene frequency in a population subject ot immigration depends, as much be obvious, on the immigration rate and on the difference of gene frequency between immigrants and natives. 3.2 Mutation 3.2.1 Non-recurrent mutation Consider first a mutational event that gives rise to just one representative of the mutated gene or chromosome in the whole population. This sort of mutation is of very little importance as a cause of change of gene frequency, because the product of a unique mutation has only a very small chance of surviving in a large population. 3.2.2 Recurrent mutation Suppose gene A1 has a frequency u per generation to A2 and gene A2 has a frequncy v to v1. Then the change of gene frequncy in one generation: \\[\\Delta q = up_0 - vq_0\\] where \\(p_0\\) and \\(p_1\\) are the initial frequncies of A1 and A2 alleles. The point of equilibrium is when \\(\\Delta q = 0\\) About the effect of mutation on gene frequncy: Mutation rates are generally very low (\\(10^-5\\) or \\(10^-6\\) for most organisms), mutation alone can produce very slow changes of gene frequncy. on an evolutionary time-scale they might be important. Some research shows that reverse mutation (from mutant to wild type) is usually much less frequent than forward mutation. 3.3 Selection The contribution of offspring to the next generation is call fitness of the individual, or sometimes the adaptive value, or selective value. If the differences of fitness are in any way associated with the presence or absence of a particular gene in the individual’s genotype, then selection operates on that gene. selective elimination may operate either through reduced viability (生存能力) or through reduced fertility (繁殖能力), in the widest sense, including mating ability, or through both. The strength of the selection is expressed as the coefficient of selection, s, which is the proportionate reduction in the gametic contribution of a particular genotype compared with a standard genotype, usually the most favoured. The contribution of the favoured genotype is taken to be 1, and the contribution of the genotype selected against is then 1-s. This expresses the fitnees of one genotype realtive to the other. Fitness, defined in this way as the proportionate contribution of offspring, should strictly speaking be called relative fitness. The fitness of a genotype depends on the environmental circumstances in which the individual lives, and also on the genotype with respect to genes at other loci.

["continuous-variation.html", "7 Continuous Variation 7.1 Metric characters 7.2 Properties of metric characters", " 7 Continuous Variation Variation without natural discontinuities, is called continuous variation, and character that exhibit it are called quantitative characters or metric characters, because their study depends on measurement instead of on counting. The branch of genetics concerned with metric characters is called quantitative genetics or biometrical genetics. How the intrinsically diiscontinous variation caused by genetic segregation is translated into the continuous variation of metric characters? one is the simultaneous segregation of many genes affecting the character the other is the superimposition of truly continuous variation arising from non-genetic causes. A gene with an effect large enough to cause a recognizable discontinuity even in the presnece of segregation at other loci and of non-genetic variation can be studied by Mendelian methods, whereas a gene whose effect is not large enough to cause a discontinuity cannot be studied individually. The distinction is reflected in the terms major gene and minor gene. Variation caused by the simultaneous segregation of many genes may be called polygenic variantion, and the minor genes concerned are sometimes referred to as polygenes. 7.1 Metric characters The frequency distributions of most metric characters approximate more or less closely to normal curves. Sometimes, however, the scale of measurement (such as in logarithmic units) must be modified if a distributiong approximating to the normal is to be obtained. There are two kinds of evidence supporting that metric characters really are controlled by genes at many loci: The first is indirect: observations in general agree well with what is expected frome the theory of polygenic inheritance The second is direct experimental evidence: loci affecting quantitative traits can be mapped on chromosomes by methods. And the loci are called Quantitative Trait Loci, or QTLs. 7.2 Properties of metric characters Two basic genetic phenomena concerned with metric characters: the first is the resemblance between relatives the second is inbreeding depression (近交衰退), with its converse hybrid vigour (杂种优势), or heterosis. The properties of a population that we can observe in connection with a metric character are means, variances and covariances. "],
["values-and-means.html", "8 Values and Means 8.1 Population mean 8.2 Average effect 8.3 Breeding value 8.4 Dominance deviation 8.5 Interaction deviation", " 8 Values and Means The concept of value is expressible in the metric units by which the character is measured. The value observed when the character is measured on an individual is the phenotypic value of that individual. All observations, whether of means, variances, or covariances, must clearly be based on measurements of phenotypic values. The first division of phenotypic value is into components attributable to the influence of genotype and environment. The genotype is the particular assemblage of genes possessed by the individual, and the environment is all the non-genetic circumstances that influence the phenotypic value. \\[P = G + E\\] where P is the phenotypic value, G is the genotypic value, and E is the environmental deviation. The mean environmental deviation in the population as a whole is taken to be zero, so that the mean phenotypic value is equal to the mean genotypic value. The term population mean then refers equally to phenotypic or to genotypic values. For the purposes of deduction we must assign arbitrary values to the genotypes under discussion. Considering a single locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), we cal the genotypic value of one homozygote +a, that of the other homozygote -a and that of the heterozygote d. (we shall adopt the convention that \\(A_1\\) is the allele that increases the value). Fig. 7.1.
