Population: in the genetic sense, a population is not just a group of individuals, but a breeding group; and the genetics of a population is concerned not only with the genetic constitution of the individuals but also with the transmission of the genes from one generation to the next. The genetic constitution of a population, refering to the genes it carries, is described by the array of gene(alleles) frequencies; that is, by specification of the alleles present at every locus and the numbers or proportions of the different alleles at each locus.

These properties of a population are derived from a theorem, or principle, known as the Hardy-Weinberg law after Hardy and Weinberg, who independently demonstrated them in 1908. A population with constant gene and genotype frequencies is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

So the normal heterozygotes frquency is 2q(1-q). The percent of heterozygotes among normal individuals is \\[H&#39; = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{2q(1-q) + (1-q)^2} = \\frac{2q}{1+q}\\] - Test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 2.2.3 Mating frequencies and another proof of the Hardy-Weinberg law Table 1.3 Nine types of mating \\(A_1A_1\\)(P) \\(A_1A_2\\)(H) \\(A_2A_2\\)(Q) \\(A_1A_1\\)(P) \\(P^2\\) PH PQ \\(A_1A_2\\)(H) PH \\(H^2\\) HQ \\(A_2A_2\\)(Q) PQ HQ \\(Q^2\\) Table 1.4 mating type mating freuqncy frequency \\(A_1A_1\\) frequency \\(A_1A_2\\) frequency \\(A_2A_2\\) \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_1A_1\\) \\(P^2\\) \\(P^2\\) - - \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_1A_2\\) 2PH PH PH - \\(A_1A_1 \\times A_2A_2\\) 2PQ - 2PQ - \\(A_1A_2 \\times A_1A_2\\) \\(H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4}H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4}H^2\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}H^2\\) \\(A_1A_2 \\times A_2A_2\\) 2HQ - HQ HQ \\(A_2A_2 \\times A_2A_2\\) \\(Q^2\\) - - \\(Q^2\\) Sums \\(p^2\\) 2pq \\(q^2\\) 2.2.4 Multiple alleles When there are more than 2 alleles at a locus, the genotype frequencies are determined by the gene(allele) frequencies in exactly the same way as with two alleles. 2.2.5 Sex-linked genes For homogametic sex (human females), gene and genotype frequency is the same as with the autosomal gene, but the heterogametic sex (human males) has only two genotypes and each individual carries only one gene instead of two. So 2/3 (4 out of 6) sex-linked alleles are carried by females and 1/3 by males in the population. Consider two alleles, A1 and A2, with frequencies p and q, and the genotypic frequencies as follow: Frequencies Females \\(A_1A_1\\) P \\(A_1A_2\\) H \\(A_2A_2\\) Q Males \\(A_1\\) R \\(A_2\\) S For females, the A1 frequncy \\(p_f = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\); for males, the \\(p_m = R\\), so the frequency of \\(A_1\\) in the whole population is, \\[\\bar{p} = \\frac{2}{3}p_f + \\frac{1}{3}p_m = \\frac{1}{3}(2P + H + R)\\] Males get their sex-linked genes only from their mothers, and females get their sex-linked genes equally from both parents. So \\[p_m^{&#39;} =p_f\\text{ and }p_f^{&#39;}=\\frac{1}{2}(p_m + p_f)\\] where, \\(p_m^{&#39;}\\) and \\(p_f^{&#39;}\\) are the gene frequnce in the progeny generation. The differnce between the frequencies in the two sexes is \\[p_f^{&#39;}-p_m^{&#39;} = \\frac{1}{2}(p_m + p_f) -p_f = -\\frac{1}{2}(p_f - p_m)\\] Therefore the distribution of the genes between the two sexes oscillates, but the difference is halved in successive generations and the population rapidly approaches an equilibrium in which the frequencies in the two sexs are equal. GetGeneFreq_whole = function(pf, pm){ ### We assume the number of males and females are equal in the population return(2/3*pf + 1/3*pm) } GetGeneFreq_sex_next = function(pf,pm){ pm_next = pf pf_next = 1/2*(pm+pf) return(c(pf_next, pm_next)) } data = c() pf = 1; pm = 0; gene=0 data = rbind(data, data.frame(gene=gene, female=pf, male=pm, whole=GetGeneFreq_whole(pf,pm))) for(gene in 1:10){ pfm = GetGeneFreq_sex_next(pf,pm) pf = pfm[1]; pm=pfm[2] data = rbind(data, data.frame(gene=gene, female=pf, male=pm, whole=GetGeneFreq_whole(pf,pm))) } library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) data.melt = melt(data, id.vars = &quot;gene&quot;) ggplot(data.melt, aes(x=gene, y=value,colour=variable), group = variable) + geom_line() + ggtitle(&quot;Approach to equilibrium under random mating for a sex-linked gene&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Generation&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Gene(allele) Frequency&quot;) 2.2.6 More than one locus Disequilibrium with respect to two or more loci is called gametic phase disequilibrium, or linkage disequilibrium, irrespective of whether the loci are linked or not. Disequilibrium can arise from intermixture of populations with different gene frequencies, or from chance in small populations. Disequilibrium can also be produced, and maintained, by selection favouring one combination of alleles over another.

Because 1-pchisq(0.93,1)=0.3348629, it’s also not significance, but less than 0.5. The maximum of the absolute value of D is 0.25 when \\(p_A = q_A = p_B = q_B = 0.5\\). \\(D_{max}\\) is the largest numerical value D coud be, given the observed gene fequncies. If two loci are linked on the same chromosome, the gamete type \\(A_1B_1\\) in the progeny generation can be obtainded from \\(A_1B_1/A_xB_x\\) without recombination or \\(A_1B_x/A_xB_1\\) with recombination. The frequency of the former situation is r(1-c), r being the frequency of \\(A_1B_1\\) in the parental gamets and c the recombination frequncy. The frequency of later situation is \\(p_Ap_Bc\\). Therefore the frequency of \\(A_1B_1\\) in the progeny gamets is \\[r&#39; = r(1-c) + p_Ap_Bc\\] and the disequilibrium in the progeny generation is \\[D&#39; = r&#39; - p_Ap_B = D(1-c)\\] In a more general way, after any number t of generations, the disequilibrium is given by \\[D_t = D_0 (1-c)^t\\] plot(c(0,12),c(0,1),col=&quot;white&quot;,main=&quot;Approach to equilibrium under random mating\\nof two loci, considered jointly.&quot;,xlab=&quot;Generation&quot;, ylab=&quot;D&quot;) t = 0:12;d0 = 1 lines(t,d0*(1-0.05)^t, col=1);text(10,0.7,&quot;0.05&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.1)^t, col=2);text(9,0.47,&quot;0.1&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.2)^t, col=3);text(7,0.3,&quot;0.2&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.3)^t, col=4);text(6,0.2,&quot;0.3&quot;) lines(t,d0*(1-0.5)^t, col=5);text(4.5,0.1,&quot;0.5&quot;) 2.3 Non-random mating There are two distinct forms of non-random mating. The first is when mated individuals are related to each other by ancestral descent. This tends to increase the frequencies of homozygotes at all loci. The second is when individuals tend to mate preferentially with respect to their genotypes at any particular locus under consideration. If mated pairs are of the same phenotype more often than would occur by chance, this is called assortative mating, and if less often, it is called disassortative mating. 2.3.1 Assortative mating The effect of assortative mating on genotype frequencies among progeny is to increase the frequencies of homzygotes and reduce that of heterozygotes.

["changes-of-gene-frequency.html", "3 Changes of Gene Frequency 3.1 Migration 3.2 Mutation 3.3 Selection 3.4 Equilibria 3.5 Polymorphism", " 3 Changes of Gene Frequency There are two sorts of process through which changes of gene frequency, and consequently of genotype frequencies, are brought about: systematic processes, which tend to change the gene frequency in a manner predictable both in amount and in direction migration mutation selection dispersive process, which arises in small populations from the effects of sampling, and is predictable in amount but not in direction. 3.1 Migration A large population consists of a proportion m of new immigrants in each generation, let the frequency of a certain gene(allele) be \\(q_m\\) ammong the immigrants and \\(q_0\\) among the natives. The frequency of the gene in the mixed population \\(q_1\\), will be: \\[q_1 = mq_m + (1-m)q_0 = m(q_m-q_0)+q_0\\] the change of gene frequency, \\(\\Delta q\\), \\[\\Delta q = q_1 - q_0 = m(q_m - q_0)\\] It shows the rate of change of gene frequency in a population subject ot immigration depends, as much be obvious, on the immigration rate and on the difference of gene frequency between immigrants and natives. 3.2 Mutation 3.2.1 Non-recurrent mutation Consider first a mutational event that gives rise to just one representative of the mutated gene or chromosome in the whole population. This sort of mutation is of very little importance as a cause of change of gene frequency, because the product of a unique mutation has only a very small chance of surviving in a large population. 3.2.2 Recurrent mutation Suppose gene A1 has a frequency u per generation to A2 and gene A2 has a frequncy v to v1. Then the change of gene frequncy in one generation: \\[\\Delta q = up_0 - vq_0\\] where \\(p_0\\) and \\(p_1\\) are the initial frequncies of A1 and A2 alleles. The point of equilibrium is when \\(\\Delta q = 0\\) About the effect of mutation on gene frequncy: Mutation rates are generally very low (\\(10^-5\\) or \\(10^-6\\) for most organisms), mutation alone can produce very slow changes of gene frequncy. on an evolutionary time-scale they might be important. Some research shows that reverse mutation (from mutant to wild type) is usually much less frequent than forward mutation. 3.3 Selection The contribution of offspring to the next generation is call fitness of the individual, or sometimes the adaptive value, or selective value. If the differences of fitness are in any way associated with the presence or absence of a particular gene in the individual’s genotype, then selection operates on that gene. selective elimination may operate either through reduced viability (生存能力) or through reduced fertility (繁殖能力), in the widest sense, including mating ability, or through both. The strength of the selection is expressed as the coefficient of selection, s, which is the proportionate reduction in the gametic contribution of a particular genotype compared with a standard genotype, usually the most favoured. The contribution of the favoured genotype is taken to be 1, and the contribution of the genotype selected against is then 1-s. This expresses the fitnees of one genotype realtive to the other. Fitness, defined in this way as the proportionate contribution of offspring, should strictly speaking be called relative fitness. The fitness of a genotype depends on the environmental circumstances in which the individual lives, and also on the genotype with respect to genes at other loci.

["continuous-variation.html", "7 Continuous Variation 7.1 Metric characters 7.2 Properties of metric characters", " 7 Continuous Variation Variation without natural discontinuities, is called continuous variation, and character that exhibit it are called quantitative characters or metric characters, because their study depends on measurement instead of on counting. The branch of genetics concerned with metric characters is called quantitative genetics or biometrical genetics. How the intrinsically diiscontinous variation caused by genetic segregation is translated into the continuous variation of metric characters? one is the simultaneous segregation of many genes affecting the character the other is the superimposition of truly continuous variation arising from non-genetic causes. A gene with an effect large enough to cause a recognizable discontinuity even in the presnece of segregation at other loci and of non-genetic variation can be studied by Mendelian methods, whereas a gene whose effect is not large enough to cause a discontinuity cannot be studied individually. The distinction is reflected in the terms major gene and minor gene. Variation caused by the simultaneous segregation of many genes may be called polygenic variantion, and the minor genes concerned are sometimes referred to as polygenes. 7.1 Metric characters The frequency distributions of most metric characters approximate more or less closely to normal curves. Sometimes, however, the scale of measurement (such as in logarithmic units) must be modified if a distributiong approximating to the normal is to be obtained. There are two kinds of evidence supporting that metric characters really are controlled by genes at many loci: The first is indirect: observations in general agree well with what is expected frome the theory of polygenic inheritance The second is direct experimental evidence: loci affecting quantitative traits can be mapped on chromosomes by methods. And the loci are called Quantitative Trait Loci, or QTLs. 7.2 Properties of metric characters Two basic genetic phenomena concerned with metric characters: the first is the resemblance between relatives the second is inbreeding depression (近交衰退), with its converse hybrid vigour (杂种优势), or heterosis. The properties of a population that we can observe in connection with a metric character are means, variances and covariances. "],
["values-and-means.html", "8 Values and Means 8.1 Population mean 8.2 Average effect 8.3 Breeding value 8.4 Dominance deviation 8.5 Interaction deviation 8.6 Note: Proof of the slope of regression line", " 8 Values and Means The concept of value is expressible in the metric units by which the character is measured. The value observed when the character is measured on an individual is the phenotypic value of that individual. All observations, whether of means, variances, or covariances, must clearly be based on measurements of phenotypic values. The first division of phenotypic value is into components attributable to the influence of genotype and environment. The genotype is the particular assemblage of genes possessed by the individual, and the environment is all the non-genetic circumstances that influence the phenotypic value. \\[P = G + E\\] where P is the phenotypic value, G is the genotypic value, and E is the environmental deviation. The mean environmental deviation in the population as a whole is taken to be zero, so that the mean phenotypic value is equal to the mean genotypic value. The term population mean then refers equally to phenotypic or to genotypic values. For the purposes of deduction we must assign arbitrary values to the genotypes under discussion. Considering a single locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), we cal the genotypic value of one homozygote +a, that of the other homozygote -a and that of the heterozygote d. (we shall adopt the convention that \\(A_1\\) is the allele that increases the value). Fig. 7.1. Arbitrarily assigned genotypic values 8.1 Population mean Table 7.1 Genotype Frequency Value Freq. * Val. \\(A_1A_1\\) \\(p^2\\) +a \\(p^2a\\) \\(A_1A_2\\) 2pq d 2pqd \\(A_2A_2\\) \\(q^2\\) -a -q^2a Sum = a(p-q)+2pqd The population mean is thus \\[M = a(p-q)+2dpq\\] This is both the mean genotypic value and the mean phenotypic value of the population with respect to the character. The contribution of any locus to the population mean thus has two terms: a(p-q) attributable to homozygotes, and 2dpq attributable to heterozygotes. If there is no dominance (d=0), M = a(1-2q); if ther is complete domiance (d=a), \\(M = a(1-2q^2)\\). The total range of value attributable to the locus is 2a, in the abseence of overdomiance. (M=-a when q=1; M=a when q=0) We suppose that the combination of genes at several loci is by addition. Then the population mean: \\[M = \\sum a(p-q) + 2\\sum dpq\\] 8.2 Average effect The value associated with genes(alleles) as distinct from genotypes is known as the average effect. There are several ways in which average effects can be defined. One defination is this: the average effect of a particular gene (allele) is the mean deviation from the population mean of individuals which received that gene (allele) from one parent, the gene (allele) from the other parent havving come at random from the population. Table 7.2 Type of gamete genotype \\(A_1A_1\\) (a) genotype \\(A_1A_2\\) (d) genotype \\(A_2A_2\\) (-a) Mean value of genotypes produced Population mean to be deducted Average effect of gene(allele) \\(A_1\\) p q pa+qd a(p-q)+2dpq q(a+d(q-p)) \\(A_2\\) p q -qa+pd - -p(a+d(q-p)) The gametes carring \\(A_1\\) unite at random with gametes from the population, the frequencies of the genotypes will be p of \\(A_1A_1\\) and q of \\(A_1A_2\\). The genotypic value of \\(A_1A_1\\) is +a and that of \\(A_1A_2\\) is d, the mean is pa+qd. The difference between this mean and the population mean is the average effect of the gene (allele) \\(A_1\\), which we use the symbol \\(\\alpha_1\\): \\[\\alpha_1 = pa+qd-(a(p-q)+2dpq) = q(a+d(q-p))\\] Similarly, the average effect of the gene \\(A_2\\) is \\[\\alpha_2 = -p(a+d(q-p))\\] The average effect of the gene substitution (allele substitution) is simple the difference between the average effects of two alleles: \\[\\alpha = \\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2 = a + d(q-p)\\] And then the average effects of the two alleles, when expressed in terms of the average effect of the gene substitution, are \\[\\alpha_1 = q\\alpha\\] \\[\\alpha_2 = -p \\alpha\\] 8.3 Breeding value The value of an individual, judged by the mean value of its progeny, is called the breeding value of the individual. For a single locus with two alleles, the breeding values of the genotypes are as follows: Genotype Breeding value \\(A_1A_1\\) \\(2\\alpha_1 = 2q\\alpha\\) \\(A_1A_2\\) \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = (q-p)\\alpha\\) \\(A_2A_2\\) \\(2\\alpha_2 = -2p\\alpha\\) Consideration of the definition of breeding value will show that in a population in HWE the mean breeding value must be zero. \\[2q\\alpha \\times p^2 + (q-p)\\alpha \\times 2pq -2p\\alpha \\times q^2 = 2pq\\alpha(p+q-p-q)=0\\] 8.4 Dominance deviation For a single locus, the difference between the genotypic value G and the breeding value of A of a particular genotype is known as the dominance deviation D, so that \\[G = A + D\\] ## initial the value a = 1 d=3/4 q=1/4 ## calculate other values p=1-q population_mean = a*(p-q) + 2*d*p*q ### population mean alpha = a + d*(q-p) ### the average effect of an allelic substitution alpha1 = q*alpha ### average effect of A1 allele alpha2 = -p*alpha ### average effect of A2 allele ## vectors genotype = c(0,1,2) ### genotype coded by the number of allele A1 genotype_value = c(-a,d,a) ### gennotypic values genotype_frq = c(q^2, 2*p*q, p^2) ### genotype frequence breeding_value = c(-2*p*alpha,(q-p)*alpha, 2*q*alpha) ### breeding values for each genotype group ## plot - basic frame par(mar = c(5,4,4,4) + 0.1) plot(c(0,2),c(-1.2,1.2),col=&quot;white&quot;,xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;Frequency&quot;,ylab=&quot;Genotypic values&quot;) mtext(&quot;Breeding values&quot;, side = 4, line = 3, cex = par(&quot;cex.lab&quot;)) axis(side=2, at=c(genotype_value,0), labels= c(&quot;-a&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;+a&quot;,&quot;0&quot;),las=1) axis(side=1, at=c(0,1,2),labels=c(&quot;A2A2(0)&quot;,&quot;A1A2(1)&quot;,&quot;A1A1(2)&quot;)) axis(side = 4, at=c(breeding_value,0)+population_mean, labels= c(&quot;-2pα&quot;,&quot;(q-p)α&quot;,&quot;2qα&quot;,&quot;0&quot;),las=1) ### Breeding value is deviations from the population mean. ## plot - genotypic values points(genotype, genotype_value,pch=16) ## plot - the regression line, Fisher&#39;s decomposition y = rep(genotype_value,genotype_frq*16) x = rep(genotype, genotype_frq*16) lmfit = lm(y~x) b0 = lmfit$&quot;coeff&quot;[1] b1 = lmfit$&quot;coeff&quot;[2] abline(b0,b1) ## plot - some indicating lines, points points(0,population_mean+2*alpha2) points(1,population_mean+alpha1+alpha2) points(2,population_mean+2*alpha1) lines(c(0,1),c(population_mean+2*alpha2,population_mean+2*alpha2),lty=2) lines(c(1,1),c(population_mean+2*alpha2,population_mean+alpha1+alpha2),lty=2) text(0.5,population_mean+2*alpha2+0.1,&quot;1&quot;) text(1.05,population_mean+2*alpha2+0.3,&quot;α&quot;) lines(c(0,0),c(-a,population_mean+2*alpha2),lty=3) lines(c(1,1),c(population_mean+alpha2+alpha1,d),lty=3) lines(c(2,2),c(a,population_mean+2*alpha1),lty=3) points((population_mean-b0)/b1,population_mean, pch=3) ### population mean In the figure, The genotypic values (closed circles) are plotted against the number of \\(A_1\\) genes in the genotype A straight regression line is fitted by least squares to these points, each point being weighted by the frequency of the genotype it represents. The position of this line gives the breeding values of each genotype, as shown by the open circles. The differences between the breeding values and the genotypic values are the dominance deviations (D), indicated by vertical dotted lines. The cross marks the population mean. The average effect \\(\\alpha\\) of the gene substitution is given by the difference in breeding value between \\(A_2A_2\\) and \\(A_1A_2\\), or between \\(A_1A_2\\) and \\(A_1A_1\\) as indicated.

Therefore in the absence of dominance, breeding values and genotypic values are the same. Genes that show no domiance (d=0) are sometimes called “additive genes”, or are said to “act additively”. 8.5 Interaction deviation When the genotype refers to more than one locus, the genotypic value may contain an additional deviation due to non-additive combination. Let \\(G_A\\) be the genotypic value of an individual attributable to one locus, \\(G_B\\) that attributable to a second locus, and G the aggregate genotypic value attributable to both loci together. Then \\[G = G_A + G_B + I_{AB}\\] where \\(I_{AB}\\) is the deviation from additive combination of these genotypic values. If I is not zero for any combination of genes at different loci, those genes are said to “interact” or to exhibit “epistasis”, the term epistasis being given a wider meaning in quantitative genetics than in Mendelian genetics. The deviation I is called the interaction deviation or epistatic deviation. For all loci together we can write, \\[G = A + D +I\\] where A is the sum of the breeding values attributable to the separate loci, and D is the sum of the dominance deviations. 8.6 Note: Proof of the slope of regression line genotype allele A1 number(x) genotypic value(y) frequency \\(A_1A_1\\) 2 +a \\(p^2\\) \\(A_1A_2\\) 1 d \\(2pq\\) \\(A_2A_2\\) 0 -a \\(q^2\\) \\(E(x) = 2p^2 + 1 \\times 2pq + 0 \\times q^2 = 2p\\) \\(Var(x) = 2pq\\) \\(E(y) = a \\times p^2 + d\\times 2pq + (-a)\\times q^2 = a(p-q)+2dpq \\text{ (Population mean)}\\) \\(E(xy) = 2 \\times a \\times p^2 + 1 \\times d \\times 2pq + 0 \\times (-a) \\times q^2 = 2pqd + 2ap^2\\) \\(Cov(y,x)= E(xy) - E(x)E(y) = 2pqd+2ap^2-2p\\times (a(p-q)+2dpq) = 2pq(d(q-p)+a)\\) \\(b_1 = \\frac{Cov(y,x)}{Var(x)} = d(q-p)+a = \\alpha\\) "],

If it’s not zero, it will increase \\(V_P\\) by \\(2\\times Cov(G,E)\\) there is no interaction between genotypes and environments.

The relative importance of heredity in determining phenotypic values is called the heritability of the character. The ratio \\(V_G/V_P\\) expresses the extent to which individuals’ phenotypes are determined by the genotypes. This is called the heritability in the broad sense, or the degree of genetic determination. The ratio \\(V_A/V_P\\) expresses the extent to which phenotypes are determined by the genes transmitted from the parents. This is called the heritability in the narrow sense, or simply the heritability. The heritability \\(V_A/V_P\\) determines the degree of resemblance between relatives and is therefore of the greatest importance in breeding programmes. The degree of genetic determination \\(V_G/V_P\\) is of more theoretical interest than practical importance. 9.1.2 Estimation of the degree of genetic determination, \\(V_G/V_P\\) Neither the genotypic nor the environmental components of variance, \\(V_G\\) and \\(V_E\\), can be estimated directly from observations on a single populations, but in certain circumstances they can be estimated in experimental populations. Individuals with identical genotypes can be obtained from a highly inbred line or the \\(F_1\\) of a cross between two such lines, or from a clone propagated from a single individual. (Identical twins in man and cattle also provide individuals of identical genotype, but their use in partitioning the variance is very limited for reasons to be discussed in Chapter 10.) 9.2 Genetic components of variance 9.2.1 Additive and dominance variance The information needed to obtain expressions for the variance of breeding values and the variance of dominance deviations was given in the last chapter in Table 7.3. (Note: the expected of breeding values and domiance deviations are both 0.) The additive variance, which is the vraince of breeding values, is obtained as follows: \\[V_A = p^2 \\times (2q\\alpha)^2 + 2pq \\times ((q-p)\\alpha)^2 + q^2 \\times (-2p\\alpha)^2 = 2pq[a+d(q-p)]^2\\] Similarly, the variance of domiance deviations is \\[V_D = p^2 \\times (-2q^2d)^2 + 2pq \\times (2pqd)^2 + q^2 \\times (-2p^2d)^2 = (2pqd)^2\\] 9.2.2 Total genetic variance So, the genotypic variance is \\[V_G = V_A + V_D = 2pq[a+d(q-p)]^2 + [2pqd]^2\\] Note: cov(A,D) = 0 due to the least square estimation. va = function(a, d, p){ q = 1 - p return(2*p*q*(a+d*(q-p))^2) } vd = function(a, d, p){ q = 1 - p return((2*p * q *d)^2) } vg = function(a, d, p){ return(va(a,d,p) + vd (a,d,p)) } p = seq(0,1,0.01); q=1-p layout(matrix(1:3,1,3)) a=1; d=0 plot(c(0,1),c(0,1),col = &quot;white&quot;, main=paste(&quot;a=&quot;,a,&quot;, d=&quot;,d,sep=&quot;&quot;), xlab=&quot;Gene(Allele) frequency, q&quot;, ylab=&quot;genetic components of variance&quot;) lines(q, vg(a,d,p),col=&quot;red&quot;) lines(q, vd(a,d,p),col=&quot;green&quot;) lines(q, va(a,d,p),col=&quot;blue&quot;) a=1; d=1 plot(c(0,1),c(0,1),col = &quot;white&quot;, main=paste(&quot;a=&quot;,a,&quot;, d=&quot;,d,sep=&quot;&quot;), xlab=&quot;Gene(Allele) frequency, q&quot;, ylab=&quot;genetic components of variance&quot;) lines(q, vg(a,d,p),col=&quot;red&quot;) lines(q, vd(a,d,p),col=&quot;green&quot;) lines(q, va(a,d,p),col=&quot;blue&quot;) a=0; d=1 plot(c(0,1),c(0,1),col = &quot;white&quot;, main=paste(&quot;a=&quot;,a,&quot;, d=&quot;,d,sep=&quot;&quot;), xlab=&quot;Gene(Allele) frequency, q&quot;, ylab=&quot;genetic components of variance&quot;) lines(q, vg(a,d,p),col=&quot;red&quot;) lines(q, vd(a,d,p),col=&quot;green&quot;) lines(q, va(a,d,p),col=&quot;blue&quot;) legend(0.1,1,&quot;Genotypic variance&quot;,lty = 1, col =&quot;red&quot;, bty=&quot;n&quot;) legend(0.1,0.95,&quot;Additive variance&quot;,lty = 1, col =&quot;blue&quot;, bty=&quot;n&quot;) legend(0.1,0.9,&quot;Dominance variance&quot;,lty = 1, col =&quot;green&quot;, bty=&quot;n&quot;) The graphs show the amounts of genotypic, additive, domiance variance arising from a single locus with two alleles, plotted against the gene(allele) frequency in threes cases: 1) no dominance (d=0); 2) complete dominance (d=a); 3) “pure” overdominance. The general conclusion to be drawn from these graphs is that genes contribute much more variance when at intermediate frequencies than when at high or low frequencies: recessives at low frequency, in particular, contribute very little variance. 9.2.3 Interaction variance If the genotypes at different loci show epistatic interaction, then the interactions give rise to a component of variance \\(V_I\\), which is the variance of the interaction deviations. Theoretical description of the properties of interaction variances rests on its further subdivision into components. It is first subdivided according to the number of loci involved: two-factor interaction arises from the interaction of two loci, three-factor from three loci, etc. Interactions involving larger numbers of loci contribute so little variance that they can be ignored. The nxt subdivision of the interaction variance is according to whether the interaction involves breeding values or domiance deviations. There are thus three sorts of two-factor interactions. Interaction between the two breeding values gives rise to additive \\(\\times\\) additive variance, \\(V_{AA}\\); interaction between the breeding value of one locus and the domiance deviation of the other gives rise to additive \\(\\times\\) domiance variance, \\(V_{AD}\\); and interaction between the two domiance deviations give rise to domiance \\(\\times\\) domiance variance, \\(V_{DD}\\). So, \\[V_I = V_{AA} + V_{AD} + V_{DD} + etc.\\] It is not easy, however, to estimate the amout of variance that it generates, and little is known about its relative importance as a source of variation. Th e experimental evidence is reviewd by Barker (1979). For further details of epistatic interaction, see Cockerham (1954, 1963), Kempthorne (1957), Crow and Kimura (1970). 9.2.4 Variance due to disequilibrium The disequilibrium when the genotype freuqncies at two or more loci consideered jointly introduces an additional source of genetic variance. For simplicity, consider just tow loci which do not interact in the manner described above. Let G’ and G’‘be genotypic values of individuals with respect to each locus separately, and let G be the genotypic value with respect to both jointly, i.e., G = G’ + G’’. The total genotypic variance caused by the two loci together is then \\[V_G = V_{G&#39;} + V_{G&#39;&#39;} + 2 cov(G&#39;,G&#39;&#39;)\\] 9.3 Correlation and interaction between genotype and environment 9.3.1 Correlation \\[V_P = V_G + V_E + 2cov(G,E)\\] 9.3.2 Interaction \\[P = G + E + I_{GE}\\] \\[V_P = V_G + V_E + 2cov_{GE} + V_{GE}\\] The variance due to interaction is included with the environmental variance estimated from the phenotypic variance of that genotype. To some extent, the environmental variance is a property of the genotype. But the source of the variation is environmental and not genetic. It is therefore logical, as well as experimentally necessary, to regard any variance due to genotype-environment interaction as being part of the environmental variance included in any estimate of \\(V_E\\). 9.3.2.1 Environmental sensitivity Some of the genotype-environment interaction can be ascribed to differences of sensitivity of different genotypes. Then environmental sensitivity of a genotype is also known as its “reaction norm”. The only way in which environments can be quantified is by the mean performance of all the genotypes. In other words, the measure of an environment is the mean of all genotypes in that environment. This will be called the environmental value. The variance due to interaction of genotypes with the specific environments is estimated from an analysis of variance, and the amount attributable to differences of sensitivity is obtained from the heterogeneity of regeression slops. 9.4 Environmental variance Environmental variance, which by definition embraces all variation of non-genetic origin, can have a great variety of causes and its nature depends very much on the character and the organism studied. Nutritional（营养因素） and climatic（气候因素） factors Maternal effects（母亲因素） prenatal influences（出生前影响） postnatal influences（出生后影响） Error of measurement 9.4.1 Multiple measurements: repeatability When more than one measurement of the character can be made on each individual, the phenotypic variance can be partitioned into variance within individuals and variance between individuals. This partitioning leads to a ratio of variance components called the repeatability. temporal（时间的） repetition spatial（空间的） repetition In order that we may discuss both temporal and spatial repetition together, we shall use the terms special environmental variance, \\(V_{Es}\\), to refer to the within-individual variance arising from temporary or localized circumstances; and general environmental variance, \\(V_{Eg}\\), to refer to the environmental variance contributing to the between-individual component and arising from permanent or non-localized circumstances. The ratio of the between-individual component to the total phenotypic variance is the intraclass correlation r. It is the correlation between repeated measurements of the same individual, and is known as the repeatability of the character. \\[V_P = (V_G + V_{Eg}) + V_{Es}\\] \\[r = \\frac{V_G + V_{Eg}}{V_P}\\] \\[\\frac{V_{Es}}{V_P} = 1-r\\] It can be seen that the repeatability sets an upper limit to the degree of genetic determination \\(V_G/V_P\\), and to the heritability \\(V_A/V_P\\). 9.5 Summary of variance partitioning Table 8.5 Summary of variance partitioning Data needed Partition made Ratio estimated Resemblance between relatives \\((V_A):(V_{NA} + V_{Eg} + V_{Es})\\) heritability, \\(V_A/V_P\\) Genetically uniform group \\((V_A + V_{NA}):(V_{Eg} + V_{Es}) = (V_G):(V_E)\\) degree of genetic determination, \\(V_G/V_P\\) Multiple measurements \\((V_G + V_{Eg}):V_{Es}\\) repeatability (\\(V_G+V_{Eg}/V_P\\)) All three \\(V_A:V_{NA}:V_{Eg}:V_{Es}\\) "],
["resemblance-between-relatives.html", "10 Resemblance between relatives 10.1 Genetic covariance 10.2 Environmental covariance 10.3 Phenotypic resemblance", " 10 Resemblance between relatives The resemblance between relatives is one of the basic genetic phenomena displayed by metric characters, and the degree of resemblence is a property of the character. casual components observational components The resemblance between related individuals, can be looked at similarity of individuals in the same group difference between individuals in different groups The covariance of related individuals is a new property of the population. Both genetic and environmental sources of variance contribute to the covaraince of relatives, the covariance of phenotypic values being the sum of the genetic and environmental covariances. 10.1 Genetic covariance Assumpation: HWE, random mating, no epistatic interaction. 10.1.1 Offspring and one parent Way 1: The covariance is that of an individual’s genotypic value with half its breeding value. \\[cov_{OP} = cov(G,\\frac{1}{2}A) = cov(A+D,\\frac{1}{2}A) = cov(A,\\frac{1}{2}A) + cov(D,\\frac{1}{2}A) = \\frac{1}{2}V_A\\] Note: cov(D,A) = 0 The genetic covariance of offspring and one parent is therefore half the additive genetic variance of the parents. Way 2: For one locus with two alleles, we can get the table below. Table 9.1 Parents’ Gentoype Genotype Frequence Genotypic value Breeding value Offspring mean genotypic value \\(A_1A_1\\) \\(p^2\\) \\(2q(\\alpha-qd)\\) \\(2q\\alpha\\) \\(q\\alpha\\) \\(A_1A_2\\) \\(2pq\\) \\((q-p)\\alpha+2pqd\\) \\((q-p)\\alpha\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}(q-p)\\alpha\\) \\(A_2A_2\\) \\(q^2\\) \\(-2p(\\alpha+pd)\\) \\(-2p\\alpha\\) \\(-p\\alpha\\) Note: the genotypic value in the table is the deviations from the population mean. \\[cov_{OP} = [2q(\\alpha-qd)] \\times [q\\alpha] \\times [p^2] + [(q-p)\\alpha+2pqd] \\times [\\frac{1}{2}(q-p)\\alpha] \\times[2pq] + [-2p(\\alpha+pd)]\\times [-p\\alpha] \\times [q^2] = pq\\alpha^2 = \\frac{1}{2}V_A\\] Summing over all loci we again reach the conclusion that the covariance of offspring and one parent is equal to half the additive variance. The regression of offspring on one parent is got by dividing the covariance by the variance of the parents, which is the phenotypic variance of the population. \\[b_{OP} = \\frac{cov_{OP}}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_A}{V_P}\\] 10.1.2 Offspring and mid-parent Way 1: \\[cov_{O\\bar{P}} = cov(\\frac{1}{2}(G_1+G_2),\\frac{1}{2}A) = \\frac{1}{2}(cov_{OP_1} + cov_{OP_2}) = \\frac{1}{2}V_A\\] If \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) have the same variance, then \\(cov_{OP_1}\\) = \\(cov_{OP_2}\\)/ Thus, provided the two sexes have equal variances, the covariance of offspring and mid-parent is the same as that of offspring with one parent.

The mean genotypic value of the group of half sibs is by definition half the breeding value of the common parent. The covariance is the variance of the true means of the half-sib groups, and is therefore the variance of half the breeding values of the common parents: \\[cov_{(HS)} = V_{\\frac{1}{2}A} = \\frac{1}{4}V_A\\] Way 2: From table 9.1, we can get \\[cov_{(HS)} = [q\\alpha]^2 \\times p^2 + [\\frac{1}{2}(q-p)\\alpha]^2 \\times 2pq + [-p\\alpha]^2 \\times q^2 = \\frac{1}{2}pq\\alpha^2 = \\frac{1}{4}V_A\\] The degree of resemblance between sibs is expressed as the intraclass correlation, which is the between-group varaince, i.e., the covariance as a proportion of the total varaince. So the correlation of half sibs is \\[t= \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{V_A}{V_P}\\] 10.1.4 Full sibs The covariance of full sibs is less simple than those of the relationships so far considered, because the domiance variance contributes to it. Way 1: Consider the covariance due to the additive variance first. Full sibs have both parents in common, so the covariance is the variance of \\(\\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2)\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}V_A\\) if the additive variance is the same in the two sexes. Now consider the contribution of domiance. It should be \\(\\frac{1}{4}V_D\\). \\[Cov_{(FS)} = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D\\] Way 2: From Table 9.2, \\[cov_{(FS)} = a^2 \\times p^4 + [\\frac{1}{2}(a+d)]^2 \\times 4p^3q + d^2\\times 2p^2q^2 + \\frac{1}{4}d^2 \\times 4p^2q^2 + [\\frac{1}{2}(-a+d)]^2 \\times 4pq^3 + a^2\\times q^4 - [a(p-q)+2dpq]^2\\] \\[cov_{(FS)} = cov_{O\\bar{P}} + d^2p^2q^ = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D\\] The correlation of full sibs is: \\[t = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D}{V_P}\\] In principle the difference between the covariances of full sibs and of half sibs provides a way of estimating the domiance variance, since \\(cov_{(FS)}-2cov_{(HS)} = \\frac{1}{4}V_D\\). In practice, however, this can be done only if there is no environmental contributions to the phenotypic covariances. 10.1.5 Twins For dizygotic (fraternal) twins are related as full sibs and their genetic covariance is that of full sibs. For monozygotic (identical) twins have identical genotypes, so there is no genetic variance within pairs and the whole of the genetic vaiance appears in the between-pair component. The genetic covariance is therefore \\[cov_{(MZ)} = V_G\\] 10.1.6 General The generalized covariance for any sort of relationship is \\[cov = rV_A + uV_D\\] The coefficient r of the additive varaince is sometimes called the coefficient of relationship, or the theoretical correlation.
