# Small Populations: II. Less Simplified Conditions

## Effective population size

### exclusion of closely related matings

### Different numbers of males and females

### Unequal numbers in successive generations

### Non-random distribution of family size

### Minimal inbreeding

### Overlapping generations

## Mutation, migration, and selection

### Non-recurrent neutral mutation

### Recureent mutation and migration

### Selection

## Random drift in natural populations

## Polymorphism

### Neutral theory
