# Values and Means

The concept of **value** is expressible in the metric units by which the character is measured. The value observed when the character is measured on an individual is the **phenotypic value** of that individual. All observations, whether of means, variances, or covariances, must clearly be based on measurements of phenotypic values.

The first division of phenotypic value is into components attributable to the influence of genotype and environment. The **genotype** is the particular assemblage of genes possessed by the individual, and the **environment** is all the non-genetic circumstances that influence the phenotypic value.

$$P = G + E$$

where P is the phenotypic value, G is the genotypic value, and E is the environmental deviation.

The mean environmental deviation in the population as a whole is taken to be zero, so that the mean phenotypic value is equal to the mean genotypic value. The term **population mean** then refers equally to phenotypic or to genotypic values.

For the purposes of deduction we must assign arbitrary values to the genotypes under discussion. Considering a single locus with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$, we cal the genotypic value of one homozygote +a, that of the other homozygote -a and that of the heterozygote d. (we shall adopt the convention that $A_1$ is the allele that increases the value).
